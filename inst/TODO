TODO
-----------------------
  General:
  o merge multiOmicsPlot to one method call (function call)
  o interactive QC report

  Visuals:
  o TE plots
  o DE plots
  o two strands support

  Annotation:
  o on demand rendering of underlying sequence (nucleotide and aminoacid)
  o add codon and aa information as hoverinfo; mind multiple tracks - there is no need to add codon information for each track, it should be tethered to the x position.
  o start codon context score track
  o codon usage track
  o phyloP (conservation) track
  o Ka/Ks support

  UI:
  o deploy shiny
  o add support of config file for argument handling
  o allow for data export as .csv

  Data management:
  o replicate and sample merging
  o access and navigation over large number of experiments - hierarchical access i.e. by organism
  o searchable metadata tables for studies
